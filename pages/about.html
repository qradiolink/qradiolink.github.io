        <h2>About QRadioLink</h2>
<p><em>QRadioLink</em> is a GNU/Linux multimode SDR (software defined radio) transceiver application using the Internet for VOIP communication (radio over IP), built on top of <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU radio</a>, 
which allows experimenting with software defined radio hardware using different digital and analog radio signals and a Qt5 user interface.</p>
<p>Its primary purpose is educational (demonstrating radio communications to children at schools), but it can also be customized for low power data communications on various ISM frequency bands.
It can also be used as an amateur radio SDR transceiver for experimentation.</p>

<p><img alt="Night mode" src="/images/qradiolink63.png" title="RX" /></p>

<p>Possible applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISM band communications</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi hobby RF communications</li>
<li>Radio over IP, Internet linking of semi-duplex or full duplex remote radio nodes</li>
<li>point to point IP radio network links</li>
<li>amateur radio field configurable repeater with remote management</li>
<li>sattelite amateur radio communications</li>
<li>homebrew radio hotspot for digital voice modes in amateur radio bands</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alternatives to QRadioLink</h2>

<p>Free software projects that work on Linux and have similar features to QRadioLink are listed below.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://freedv.org/">FreeDV</a> is a Digital Voice mode for HF radio. The application works for Windows, Linux and OSX and allows any SSB radio to be used for low bit rate digital voice. It is the original free software Codec2 implementation. It does not require a SDR and works with any analog radio.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.svxlink.org/">SvxLink</a> is a great project which inspired the radio linking features of QRadioLink. The Qtel component is a full-featured Echolink GUI client. It does not require using a SDR and can work with any FM radio.</li>
<li><a href="https://gqrx.dk/">Gqrx</a> is an open source software defined radio receiver (SDR) powered by the GNU Radio SDK and the Qt graphical toolkit. Gqrx inspired the use of GNU radio in QRadioLink and some features, code and architecture were copied verbatim from Gqrx as the best alternative available. Despite the graphical resemblance to it, Gqrx is much more suitable for the purpose of general SDR receiver. There are several trade-offs made in QRadioLink to emphasize CPU performance to the detriment of signal quality. One such tradeoff is the use of an audio sample rate of 8000 Hz in QRadioLink compared to the more faithful 48000 Hz in Gqrx. Other major differences are lack of Wide FM stereo, RDS decoding, lack of waterfall persistence, lack of I/Q samples recording and lower SSB / AM performance in QRadioLink. Gqrx is also more user friendly and has a wide support community.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/f4exb/sdrangel">SDRangel</a> is a full SDR transceiver for SSB, FM, DMR, D-Star, C4FM and DVB-S. It can use only SDR hardware but it supports a large number of them.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> is what QRadioLink uses under the hood. It is a great alternative for people who don't want to use SDR radios.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/on1arf/gmsk">Codec2 GMSK</a> is a great and free software alternative to D-Star on VHF-UHF handheld radios. It only requires a radio capable of 9600 baud packet.</li>
<li><a href="http://osmocom.org/projects/op25/wiki">OP25</a> is a free software implementation of D-Star, DMR and C4FM (Yaesu digital voice standard). It works with FM radios capable of 9600 baud packet as well as SDRs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tvelliott/charon">Charon</a> is a stand-alone OFDM transceiver with batman-adv mesh networking capabilities. The IP modem in Charon is very advanced and can be embedded on the PlutoSDR. It is the base for several amateur radio mesh networks. Only works with SDR hardware.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/g4klx/MMDVM">MMDVM</a> extremely robust free software implementation of D-Star, DMR and C4FM (Yaesu digital voice standard). Works with RaspberryPi, Arduino and any radios capable of 9600 baud packet.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Important: starting with GNU radio version 3.8 QRadioLink will not work anymore due to the dependency on the gr-osmosdr package which is removed from most Linux distributions</strong></p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Is the packet radio system within QRadioLink compatible with other existing amateur packet radio modes and / or FM radios?</strong><br/>
No, the packet radio modem is not compatible with FM radios and 1200 / 9600 baud amateur radio packet.<br/>
The receiver needs to be able to demodulate in a bandwidth of at least 1 MHz to receive this radio packet mode.<br/>
Furthermore, the Internet packet modes in QRadioLink do not even use the same data link layer. Instead of AX.25 frames, QRadioLink sends Ethernet frames over the air. 
This means that you do not need AX.25 Linux kernel support to create an IP link with QRadioLink. Also, both the 4FSK and DQPSK packet radio modes require a full duplex transceiver, or at least two devices (a semi-duplex transceiver and an RTL-SDR receiver for example).
</p>
<p><strong>Why does the user interface appear different from the screenshots on my computer?</strong><br/>
The screenshots are taken under KDE, a native Qt desktop environment. With GTK based desktops, the Qt theme can 
behave differently. I have not mastered yet these subtle differences. Your help is welcome.
</p>
<p><strong>I am trying to use the official Mumble server package, but it does not seem to work with QRadioLink
</strong><br/>
The best response I can come up with is that the official Mumble protocol reference possibly ommits some steps required 
to connect to the latest version of the official server. My Mumble client is written according to this document, but 
it uses the umurmur server package for this reason. Your help in resolving this issue is also welcome.
</p>
<p><strong>Why is there no Android APK for QRadioLink?</strong><br/>
Because QRadioLink is not a native Android application and needs a GNU/Linux Android container and userspace. For this reason 
the user interface is rather clunky for a mobile device and needs a rewrite. You can expect that to happen once KDE Plasma 
mobile becomes stable. While the application is not native, the performance is similar to a native application, but 
there is some overhead from the visualisation layers, especially if you use a VNC display instead of an X server. 
For most modes, expect at least 50% CPU usage on 3-4 cores running at 1.2 GHz.
</p>
<p><strong>I am running QRadioLink on a very limited CPU power platform, what can I do?</strong><br/>
The FFT and waterfall widgets are not active if you disable the FFT checkbox. No FFT is performed on the data by GNU radio and 
no UI painting is happening. When you switch FFT on, that code becomes active and the application 
takes a performance hit which is proportional to the sample rate, FFT size and the FPS. Reduce them to the minimum for lowest CPU demand. You can also try to run <strong>volk_profile</strong> before running the application and see 
whether it helps.
</p>
<p><strong>I have issues forwarding the VoIP digital audio to the radio and viceversa</strong><br/>
If your SDR receives an FM or other analog signal there is no transcoding involved and the voice packets encoded with Opus are sent 
directly to connected clients. If your SDR receives a digital voice signal like Codec2, the audio is transcoded first 
before being sent to the VoIP network. Audio artefacts and delays may be present in this case.
</p>
<p><strong>Can QRadioLink be used headless (with no graphical user interface on the Raspberry Pi?</strong><br/>
Yes, starting with version <strong>0.8.2</strong>, QRadioLink can be used as a terminal application (possibly daemonized) without X11 or any screens.
Remote operation in this case is possible either via commands sent through Mumble as private messages, or via the embedded telnet server, for which you will need
a telnet client or similar application to connect with. No authentication or security features are implemented at the moment, so you should not expose the configured 
remote port to the Internet and instead use SSH to connect to the system and telnet from there. If you are not using local audio, you will need to also enable VOIP forwarding.
</p>
<p><strong>Is there a Windows version?</strong><br/>
No. QRadioLink only works on <strong>Linux</strong> systems at the moment. However, it is not impossible to port to the Windows operating system if someone is interested to do the work, with only a few parts that are very Linux specific (including some calls into Linux kernel API). However, Windows users should keep in mind that QRadioLink is a very simple educational tool for hobbyist and learning users and cannot achieve or even wants to achieve what professional SDR applications can perform on Windows. To avoid disappointment, I am recommending some professional products with first grade suppport for the Windows OS: <a href="https://www.flexradio.com/ssdr-for-windows/">FlexRadio SmartSDR</a> and <a href="https://www.sdr-radio.com/Console">SDRConsole</a>.
